          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Services Description</h2>
          <p>
            TutorMatch provides an online platform that connects students with tutors for educational purposes. The Services 
            include, but are not limited to, tutor discovery, scheduling, messaging, virtual classroom tools, and payment processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            TutorMatch does not provide tutoring services directly. We are a platform that facilitates connections between students 
            and independent tutors. TutorMatch is not responsible for the quality, safety, or legality of the tutoring services 
            provided by tutors, the truth or accuracy of tutors' listings, the ability of tutors to teach effectively, or the 
            ability of students to pay for services.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. User Conduct</h2>
          <p>
            You agree not to use the Services to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Violate any applicable law, regulation, or these Terms</li>
            <li>Infringe the rights of any third party, including intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Payments and Fees</h2>
          <p>
            Tutors set their own rates for services provided through the platform. TutorMatch charges a service fee for the use 
            of our platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the tutor's rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            All payments are processed through our secure payment system. Students are charged at the time of booking, and funds 
            are held in escrow until the tutoring session is completed. Tutors receive payment after the session is completed, 
            minus the TutorMatch service fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Refunds may be issued in accordance with our Refund Policy, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Cancellation Policy</h2>
          <p>
            Students may cancel scheduled sessions subject to the following cancellation policy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cancellations made more than 24 hours before the scheduled session start time will receive a full refund.</li>
            <li>Cancellations made between 12 and 24 hours before the scheduled session will be charged 50% of the session fee.</li>
            <li>Cancellations made less than 12 hours before the scheduled session will be charged the full session fee.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Tutors may cancel scheduled sessions but are encouraged to provide as much advance notice as possible. Repeated 
            cancellations by tutors may result in penalties, including account suspension.
          </p>
